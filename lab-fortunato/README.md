#Lab 1

  From index.js we invoke 3 functions. We invoke greet, which we pass an argument named "name". We also
invoke arithmetic.add, which takes two arguments, two numbers. If one of this arguments is different than a number, we will get back null, thats how we did our functionality. And last but not least, arithmetic.sub. This function also takes two arguments, both numbers. Lie in the arithmetic.add, if something different than a number is passed, we will get null.

  The function greet returns a string which includes 'Hello ' plus whatever argument we passed in name.
The test worked for this function.

The function arithmetic.add returns the sum of the two numbers we passed as arguments. The test worked for this function.

The function arithmetic.sub returns the subtraction of the two numbers we passed as arguments. The test worked for this function.
