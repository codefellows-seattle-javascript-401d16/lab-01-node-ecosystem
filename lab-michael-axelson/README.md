The greet.js file exports the greet method that only accepts a string as an argument, and will console log "hello, " concatenated with whatever is passed through as a string... these conditions have been tested for numbers as well as a string

The arithmetic file exports the add and subtract methods, that add and subtract two parameters, respectively. These two methods have been tested to only take in numbers as parameters, and both return a value of null for non number inputs...

Using mocha js, I created a test.js file to test for these parameters using mocha, two for the greet method, and three for each the add and sub methods in my arithmetic.js file
