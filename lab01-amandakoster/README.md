### This code tests 3 functions.

### Arithmetic.js
The arithmetic.js module has add and subtract methods that expect params that expect two numbers and each return the sum or difference of the two numbers. For non-number inputs, the function returns null.

### Greet.js
The greet function has a single parameter name that expect a string. The greet function should return the input name concatenated with "Hello, ",  and returns null if the input is not a string.

### Test.js
Test.js  expects the greet module to return "Hello, world!" when invoked with "world!" as a parameter. The greet module will return null if the input is not a string.

Test.js also tests the add and subtract methods on the arithmetic module that ensures the functions work as expected with number inputs and non number inputs.
