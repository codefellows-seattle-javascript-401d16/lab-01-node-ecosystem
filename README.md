# description

This app makes a function named greet and tests to see if the argument passed in is a string. If so it returns, Hello world!. If it argument passed in isn't a string it will return null.

My app also makes a function named arithmetic. It passes in two methods. One the addition method and the other the subtraction method. It tests to see if the argument passed in is a number. If a non number is passed in then it returns NaN.
