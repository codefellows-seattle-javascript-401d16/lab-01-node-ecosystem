##Testing with Mocha##

**Description**
Two separate modules have been created for the user. The greet.js module will send the user a message with their inputted name attached. If the name is not a string it will result in null. The user can utilize arithmetic.js for their own calculations. The test will add the two numbers the user passes through on the add() method and subtract the numbers on the sub() method. If the user doesn't input a number it will inform the user to input an integer.
