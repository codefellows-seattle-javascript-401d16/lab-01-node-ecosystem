##arithmetic and Greet Application writing in js

This basic application will output the 'Hello, + the name' passed in as a parameter when the function greet is invoke. The greet function only takes in a string as its parameter/argument.

This application will also do a couple basic arithmetic functions, addition and subtraction. In order for the addition or subtraction functions to work, they required a couple arguments, when the function is invoke and two parameters are passed into them, they will try to add or subtract both numbers.

On this app, basic validation is built into it, to validate that the parameters passed in are valid strings or numbers depending on which function is invoke.
