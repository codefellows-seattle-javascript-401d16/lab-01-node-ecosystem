401 JS -- Class 01 node ecosystem

 This lab took my about 3 hours. I created a directory called lib which had two modules. These happened to be greet and arithmetic. I also created a test directory which held the tests for the two modules. One of my modules inside lib is greet.js. This defines function module.export which 'name' is passed through and returns the users name + 'hello' when invoked. The other module is arithmetic.js which assigns an empty object to module exports and our variable arithmetic. Then we use the add and subtract methods to make sure that the input is a number, or else it returns null. After I created these modules, it was time to write tests to make sure that my functions were all working correctly.
