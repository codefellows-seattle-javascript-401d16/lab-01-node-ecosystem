##Description  

greet.js is a node module that contains one function.  The function takes in one argument, name, which is a string.  The passed in string is combined with the word 'Hello' to create a personalized greeting for the user.  If a non string value is passed in, the accompanying test will return null as a value.  

arithmetic.js is a node module that contains two functions.  One is an addition, the other is a subtraction.  Each function takes in two values, which are numbers.  The add function adds the two numbers together and the subtract function takes the value of the second number and subtracts it from the first number.  The accompanying test notifies whether or not a non-number value is passed in.  

These modules are created along with the help of the test framewors mocha.js and expect.js.
